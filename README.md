### Hi, I’m Suneeh 🤙🏽

I'm a 27-year-old professional full stack dev based in Germany, and I'm passionate about building nice digital experiences. On my Github you will most likely find projects that are NOT my common stack, since I want to check out other things in my spare time. Check out my [website](https://suneeh.de) to learn more about me.
