# Hi, I’m @Suneeh 🤙🏽
I'm a professional full stack dev (ASP.NET Backends with Angular Frontends). On my Github you will most likely find projects that are NOT my common stack, since I want to check out other things in my free time. 

I’m interested in cars, tech, gaming and music.

I’m currently working on the Sunshine Project that consists of a Nuxt.js App together with a 2D Godot Game. 

Feel free to message me.
